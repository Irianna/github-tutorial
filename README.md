## Git vs. GitHub
Git is the software that engineers can use to snapshot and save their codes. It help them keep track of their work and experiment with different ideas. 

- Git works in the command line, also called a terminal. Your work is saved onto your own computer. 
- Git does not need Github 

Gitub is the 'hub' that holds and saves the snapshots of code. Github also makes it easy for other coders to share and learn from each other's code.

- Github works in the cloud, where code can be shared and edited. 
- Github needs Git to work

## Initial Setup
The first step in creating one's own Github account is signing up online. 

(where I will insert the first image)
After filling this and signing up it's important to create your SSH key. This is used to authenticate your remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary. 

- Go to your Github and go to Settings 
- In the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys. 
- GO to New SSH key 
- In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. 
- Paste your key into the "Key" field.
- Click Add SSH key.

Ta-Dah! You have a new SSH key! Now you  can use your key to create a new repository or push an existing repository you have an SSH key.
